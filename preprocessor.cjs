# Goal of file: #
#################

(Perhaps I'll rename the file to bundler.cjs)

This file takes all of the Electron app's renderer process javascript files
and combines them into a single file named '__PREPROCESSEDbundle__.js'

This file is ran as a prebuild step in package.json.

The generated file named '__PREPROCESSEDbundle__.js'
is then given to babel as the build step
in order to apply the compiler configuration.

# Notes:
- Perhaps I'll rename the file to bundler.cjs
- Preprocessor text token (see "marker details comment" at end of this file) is used to strip out text from a javascript file.
    - in essence: I found that vscode wasn't showing me lsp cross file even if the files were in the same directory, and that directory was part of the workspace.
    - So, I needed to add an import to the top of each file that indicated to vscode what each file was dependent on.
    - This gave me cross file lsp.
    - (note: you probably can put a setting in package.json to do this but I thought it was an interesting problem nevertheless
             so I went about this way cause I'm not writing this code as a "job" I just wanted to do the more interesting thing
             than google for a package.json setting, in a job environment I'd never do most of the things you see me do)
    - But, you don't need the import statements after you've combined them all into a single file.
    - Thus the preprocessor text token wraps the imports so that I can remove them when I combine it all into a single file

> 
> But now, the next time that I run the program I "check whether a file alongside '__PREPROCESSEDbundle__.js' with

< ...
< 
< 1. Change Detection (Cache Invalidation)
< ...
< - File Modification Timestamps (mtime): Use fs.statSync(). Compare the modified time of the source file against the modified time of its cached version. If the source file is newer, re-process it. This is incredibly fast and requires no extra storage.
< - Hashing: Calculate an MD5 or SHA-1 hash of the source file content. If the hash matches a saved hash from the last run, skip it. This is more robust than timestamps but costs slightly more CPU.
<
< 2. Maintaining Order of Execution
< ...
<
< 3. Handling Deleted Files
< ...

> how do production grade bundlers determine whether a file has changed?

< Production-grade bundlers (like Webpack, Vite, and esbuild) balance two strategies: metadata checks for raw speed and cryptographic hashing for absolute correctness.
<
< They also treat "Watch Mode" (development) and "Persistent Caching" (subsequent cold starts) as two entirely separate problems.
<
< ...

> "Timestamps are fast, but they can be unreliable."
> 
> I'd like to start with a timestamp implementation but I worry that I somehow could edit a file,
> and end up with the same timestamp and the bundler therefore doesn't think the file has changed.
> Is this possible? How high resolution are these timestamps?

< Yes, it is theoretically possible, but practically impossible on modern operating systems unless
< your bundler runs at speeds faster than a fraction of a microsecond.
< 
< ...
<
< 1. Check for Strict Inequality (!==) instead of Greater Than (>)
< Instead of checking if the source file is newer than the cache, check if they are different.
< If you switch Git branches or roll back a file, the source file might become older than the cache. 
< Checking for strict inequality catches changes in both directions.
